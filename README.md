# Kickstart-Dapp

A Decentralized Application that allows anyone to create Startup Campaigns in the Rinkeby network (Ethereum testnetwork) 
and others can contribute Ether to the campaign and approve payment requests to the recipient if request seems legit to 
them. The Contributers get some perks decided by the campaign creater.

This web3 application makes it more secure to fund startups with reduced risk of frauds as the funds never gets transfered 
to the campaign manager. Funds are directly transfered to recipients mentioned in requests created by manager after the 
approval of majority of contributors.
